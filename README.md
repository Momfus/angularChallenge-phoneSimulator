# AngularChallengePhoneSimulator

This technical challenge was made for 5thKind Studio with Angular.

# Challenge:

 NOTE: Search in the folder src/assets/challenge-example for a mockup image to use as a base example.

 This is a "phone simulator" with each square representing an app. The apps show their name and version number. When a user clicks an app, it just gives the user some contact info.
A user should be able to add an app, but this is not finished.

 * Add a loading indicator for when we load up the cards.
 * Add validation to the version to make sure it fits semantic versioning standards (major, minor, patch)
 * Add functionally so that when you press the add button the card shows in the grid.
 * Fix the pagination so that only 9 items show per page (Bonus: in a 3x3 grid) and the number of pages is correct.
 * BONUS: Add funtionality to edit existing cards by clicking the "ng-click" functionality on the cards. A user should be allowed to cancel the editing.
